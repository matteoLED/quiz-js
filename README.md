## Quiz Project Documentation

This project is designed to create an interactive quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz consists of multiple questions with multiple-choice answers. Users can answer the questions, see the correct answers, and view their score at the end of the quiz.

## Code Structure
The code for the project is divided into several parts, each with its own functionality.

## Quiz Initialization


The code starts by importing a CSS stylesheet and a "questions" module.
A constant TIMEOUT is defined to set the maximum duration for each question.
HTML elements with the IDs "#app" (main container) and "#start" (start button) are selected.
Starting the Quiz
When the start button is clicked, the startQuiz function is called.
The startQuiz function initializes variables to track the current question and the score.
It calls the displayQuestion function to display the first question.
Utility Functions
Several utility functions are used to display and manage questions and answers:

clean(): Removes all child elements from the "#app" main container to prepare for displaying the next question.
displayQuestion(index): Displays the question and answers for the given index. If all questions have been answered, it displays an end message.
displayFinishMessage(): Displays a congratulations message and the total score at the end of the quiz.
createAnswers(answers): Creates HTML elements to display answers for a question.
getTitleElement(text): Creates an HTML <h3> element to display the question text.
formatId(text): Formats text for use as an HTML ID.
getAnswerElement(text): Creates an HTML <label> element with a checkbox to display an answer.
getSubmitButton(): Creates a submission button for each question.
showFeedback(isCorrect, correct, answer): Displays the correct answer and the user-selected answer.
getFeedbackMessage(isCorrect, correct): Creates an HTML <p> element to display a feedback message.
getProgressBar(max, value): Creates a progress bar to indicate quiz progress.
displayNextQuestionButton(callback): Displays a "Next" button to move to the next question after a certain delay.
disableAllAnswers(): Disables all checkboxes after submitting an answer.
Usage
To use this code, you should have a list of questions and answers in a JavaScript module named "questions." Ensure that the "questions" module is correctly imported and contains the quiz data.

Next, you can integrate this code into an HTML page by adding the necessary elements such as the main container "#app" and the start button "#start." Once done, you can run the quiz by clicking the start button.

Remember to customize the content of the questions and answers in the "questions" module to match your specific quiz.
